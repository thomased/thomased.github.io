# About me
I'm an evolutionary biologist, and have a particular interest in sensory ecology and visual communication. I mostly work with invertebrates for their experimental tractability in addressing questions of evolution and behaviour, and for the lesser explored opportunities afforded by non-model organisms. I'm currently a research fellow in [Darrell Kemp's](http://www.evolutionaryecologymq.com/) lab at Macquarie University, and have close ties to the [Umbers lab](http://www.kateumbers.com) at Western Sydney University.

I've just wound up my PhD, which dealt with the evolution of colour polymorphism in [conspicuous visual lures](https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&tbm=isch&as_q=gasteracantha&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgsz=&imgar=&imgc=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&safe=images&as_filetype=&as_rights=). I also have a long-standing interest in the biology of structural colouration, particularly the workings of [iridescence](https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&tbm=isch&as_q=iridescent%2C+butterfly&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgsz=&imgar=&imgc=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&safe=images&as_filetype=&as_rights=). Of course to understand the evolution of visual communication we need to 'see' the world as animals do, so I also enjoy [testing and extending](https://github.com/rmaia/pavo) methods for analysing colour traits and their visual perception.
