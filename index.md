# About me
I study behavioural and visual ecology, with a focus on the evolution of colour pattern and visual system diversity. I mostly use invertebrates, both in recognition of the enormous chunk of biological diversity they represent, and for the intriguing opportunities afforded by non-model organisms.

I'm currently a PhD candidate in the labs of [Darrell Kemp](http://www.evolutionaryecologymq.com/) and [Marie Herberstein](https://sites.google.com/site/behaviouralecologymacquarie/) at Macquarie University. Feel free to get in touch via [email](mailto:thomas.white026@gmail.com) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/tomedwhite)!
