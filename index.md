# About me
I study evolutionary and behavioural ecology, with a focus on the evolution of visual communication. I mostly use invertebrates, both in recognition of the enormous chunk of biological diversity they represent, and for the intriguing opportunities afforded by non-model organisms. I'm currently winding up my PhD in the labs of [Darrell Kemp](http://www.evolutionaryecologymq.com/) and [Marie Herberstein](https://sites.google.com/site/behaviouralecologymacquarie/) at Macquarie University.

My PhD is focused on the evolution of colour polymorphism in [deceptive visual lures](https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&tbm=isch&as_q=gasteracantha&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgsz=&imgar=&imgc=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&safe=images&as_filetype=&as_rights=). I also have a longstanding interest in the biology of structural colouration, particularly the workings of  [iridescence](https://www.google.com/search?as_st=y&tbm=isch&as_q=iridescent%2C+butterfly&as_epq=&as_oq=&as_eq=&imgsz=&imgar=&imgc=&imgcolor=&imgtype=&cr=&as_sitesearch=&safe=images&as_filetype=&as_rights=) in sexual communication systems. Of course to understand the evolution of visual communication we need to 'see' the world as non-human animals do, so I also enjoy [testing and extending](https://github.com/rmaia/pavo) methods for analysing colour traits and their visual perception.
