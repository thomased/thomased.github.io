# About me
I'm an evolutionary biologist, and have a particular interest in sensory ecology and visual communication. I mostly work with invertebrates for their experimental tractability in addressing questions of evolution and behaviour, and for the lesser explored opportunities afforded by non-model organisms. I'm currently a research fellow in [Darrell Kemp's](http://www.evolutionaryecologymq.com/) lab at Macquarie University, and have close ties to the [Umbers lab](http://www.kateumbers.com) at Western Sydney University.
