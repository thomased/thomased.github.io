I am always happy to hear from students at all levels; from potential PhD's to undergraduates looking for hands-on experience. I have projects available, or am open to any ideas that broadly align with the lab's [interests]({{ site.url }}/research). If you are motivated by questions over organisms, take a look at some [publications]({{ site.url }}/publications) and send me an email!

Aside from the very occasional funded position, there are numerous routes to securing funding for honours, PhD's, and postdocs. A few are listed below, and I will gladly do all I can to help qualified applicants attain support.

## Pathways

### Postgraduates

**PhD and Masters**  
The University of Sydney is a world-class research institution, and offers a vibrant environment within which to pursue postgraduate studies. Students will need to secure a scholarship such as an Australian Postgraduate Award or the University's equivalent (which share an application), with applications now accepted **year-round**.

**Honours**  
Honours is an extra year of study following an undergraduate degree, and involves a substantial independent research component. It's an excellent opportunity to gain significant research and project management experience, and is also a common pathway to higher-degree research.

### Postdocs

**USyd Fellowships**  
The University of Sydney offers its flagship Postdoctoral Fellowships on a yearly basis, with applications due in ***September***.

**Branco Weiss Fellowships**  
This research fellowship is designed to support postdoctoral researchers after their PhD and before their first faculty appointment. Those in current postdoctoral positions are also eligible. Ideally, fellows pursue unconventional projects in new areas of science, engineering and social sciences.

**Marie Marie Sklodowska-Curie Global Fellowships**  
These generous fellowships support secondments outside Europe for researchers based in the EU or associated countries.

Other region-specific options include National Science Foundation Fellowships (USA), NSERC Fellowships (Canada), Royal Society Fellowships (UK), Fellowships from the Swedish Research Council, Swiss National Science Foundation, The Research Council of Norway and National Science Foundation South Africa. There is [**a curated list of fellowships**](https://asntech.github.io/postdoc-funding-schemes/) from around the world that's well worth taking a look at. 

### Undergraduates

I have projects available for students interested in gaining some hand-on experience, and prefer to collaborate on substantial self-contained projects with a view to publication. Volunteers are welcome, though people should be paid for their work whenever possible, and summer research scholarships are available to second- and third-year undergraduate to that end. They're competitively awarded to students from _any_ domestic (Aus or NZ) university, include a modest stipend (~ $513 p/w) for the six week duration, and applications typically close in ***September***.
