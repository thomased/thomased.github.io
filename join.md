I am always happy to hear from students & researchers at all levels; from potential PhD's to undergraduates looking for hands-on experience. I am open to any ideas that even vaguely align with the lab's [interests]({{ site.url }}/research), or have various pre-built projects available (such as those sketched below). Feel free to take a look at some of our [work]({{ site.url }}/publications) and send me an email!

## Pathways

Aside from the occasional funded position, there are numerous routes to securing funding for honours, PhD's, and postdocs. A few are listed below, and I will gladly do all I can to help qualified applicants attain support.

**[Postdocs:](https://sydney.edu.au/research/join-us/university-of-sydney-fellowship-scheme.html)** The University of Sydney offers its flagship Postdoctoral Fellowships on a yearly basis, with applications due in ***September***.

**[PhD and Masters](https://sydney.edu.au/courses/courses/pr/doctor-of-philosophy-science.html):** Students will need to secure a scholarship such as an RTP or the University's equivalent (which share an application), with application rounds **twice per year**.

**[Honours](https://sydney.edu.au/study/find-a-course/honours.html):** Honours is an extra year of study following, or as part of, an undergraduate degree, and involves a substantial independent research component. Students both internal and external to USyd are able to apply, and it's an excellent opportunity to gain significant research experience.

**[Undergraduates](http://sydney.edu.au/medicine/study/scholarships/summer-research/index.php):** I have projects available for students interested in gaining some hand-on experience, and prefer to collaborate on substantial self-contained projects with a view to publication. Volunteers are welcome, though people should be paid for their work whenever possible, and summer research scholarships are available to second- and third-year undergraduate to that end. They're competitively awarded to students from _any_ domestic (Aus or NZ) university, include a modest stipend for the six week duration, and applications typically close in ***September***.

## Projects

Work is ongoing, and enquiries are particularly welcome, in the following general areas:

***Communication, colour, courtship, and adaptation in the wild***

This work uses beach-dwelling flies to ask how organisms gather and exchange information to solve life's daily challenges, and how environments define the sensory context in which these processes operate and evolve. The questions are many, and entail fieldwork on our beautiful beaches, and/or lab- or computational analyses of behaviour, physiology, and visual perception.

***Illuminating the visual world of pollinators***

This work uses field and/or laboratory experiments to understand how key pollinators â€”-- such as butterflies, bees, and flies --- use colour, brightness, and motion cues to make their way in the world. The questions and methods are myriad, and can be tailored to the interests of all involved.
