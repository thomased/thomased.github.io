I am always happy to hear from students at all levels; from potential PhD's to undergraduates looking for hands-on experience. I have projects available (such as those below), or am open to any ideas that broadly align with the lab's [interests]({{ site.url }}/research). Feel free to take a look at some of our [work]({{ site.url }}/publications) and send me an email!

## Pathways

Aside from the occasional funded position, there are numerous routes to securing funding for honours, PhD's, and postdocs. A few are listed below, and I will gladly do all I can to help qualified applicants attain support.

**[Postdoctoral Fellowships:](https://sydney.edu.au/research/join-us/university-of-sydney-fellowship-scheme.html)** The University of Sydney offers its flagship Postdoctoral Fellowships on a yearly basis, with applications due in ***September***.

**[PhD and Masters](https://sydney.edu.au/courses/courses/pr/doctor-of-philosophy-science.html):** Students will need to secure a scholarship such as an RTP or the University's equivalent (which share an application), with application rounds **twice per year**.

**[Honours](https://sydney.edu.au/study/find-a-course/honours.html):** Honours is an extra year of study following, or as part of, an undergraduate degree, and involves a substantial independent research component. Students both internal and external to USyd are able to apply, and it's an excellent opportunity to gain significant research experience.

**[Undergraduates](http://sydney.edu.au/medicine/study/scholarships/summer-research/index.php):** I have projects available for students interested in gaining some hand-on experience, and prefer to collaborate on substantial self-contained projects with a view to publication. Volunteers are welcome, though people should be paid for their work whenever possible, and summer research scholarships are available to second- and third-year undergraduate to that end. They're competitively awarded to students from _any_ domestic (Aus or NZ) university, include a modest stipend for the six week duration, and applications typically close in ***September***.
