<p><strong>Dr. Thomas White</strong></p>
I'm an evolutionary biologist, and have a particular interest in sensory ecology and communication. I mostly work with invertebrates for their experimental tractability in addressing questions of evolution and behaviour, and for the unique opportunities for discovery offered by non-model organisms. Since 2018 I've been an Early Career Development Fellow at the wonderful [School of Life and Environmental Sciences](http://sydney.edu.au/science/life-environment/) at [The University of Sydney](https://sydney.edu.au).
