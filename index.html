<strong>What we do</strong>
We are a research lab based in the wonderful [School of Life and Environmental Sciences](https://sydney.edu.au/science/schools/school-of-life-and-environmental-sciences.html) at [The University of Sydney](https://sydney.edu.au). We spend our time using experiments, fieldwork, and modelling to answer fundamental questions of evolution and behaviour. The world of invertebrates (especially insects) has proven a particular source of inspiration, with butterflies and spiders being mainstays in the lab, though we gladly use any system appropriate for the questions at hand. Take a look at some of our [ongoing projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/research) and [recent publications]({{ site.baseurl }}/publications) to see what we're currently up to, and feel free to get in touch! We always welcome new students, project ideas, and collaborations.
