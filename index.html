<strong>Dr. Thomas White</strong>

I'm an evolutionary biologist, and have a particular interest in sensory ecology and communication. I mostly work with invertebrates for their experimental tractability in addressing questions of evolution and behaviour, and for the opportunities afforded by non-model organisms. I've been a research fellow in <a href="http://www.evolutionaryecologymq.com/">Darrell Kemp's</a> lab at Macquarie University since receiving my PhD earlier this year, and have close ties to the <a href="http://www.kateumbers.com">Umbers lab</a> at Western Sydney University.
