<p><strong>Dr. Thomas White</strong></p>
I'm an evolutionary biologist, and have a particular interest in sensory ecology and communication. I mostly work with invertebrates for their experimental tractability in addressing questions of evolution and behaviour, and for the opportunities afforded by non-model organisms. Since 2018 I've been a lecturer in the wonderful <a href="http://sydney.edu.au/science/life-environment/">School of Life and Environmental Sciences</a> at <a href="http://sydney.edu.au">The University of Sydney</a>.
