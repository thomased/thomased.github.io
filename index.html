<p><strong>Dr. Thomas White</strong></p>
I'm an evolutionary biologist, and have a particular interest in sensory ecology and communication. I mostly work with invertebrates for their tractability in addressing questions of evolution and behaviour, and for the unique opportunities for discovery offered by non-model organisms. In 2018 I joined the wonderful <a href="http://sydney.edu.au/science/life-environment/">School of Life and Environmental Sciences</a> at <a href="https://sydney.edu.au">The University of Sydney</a> as a lecturer and Early Career Development Fellow.
