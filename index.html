<strong>What we do</strong>

<br>

We are a research lab based in the wonderful <a href="https://sydney.edu.au/science/schools/school-of-life-and-environmental-sciences.html">School of Life and Environmental Sciences</a> at <a href="https://sydney.edu.au">The University of Sydney</a>. We spend our time using experiments, fieldwork, and modelling to answer questions of adaptive evolution and behaviour. Non-model invertebrates have proven a particular source of inspiration, with butterflies, flies, and spiders being mainstays in the lab, though we gladly use any system appropriate for the questions at hand. Take a look at some of our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/research">ongoing projects</a> and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/publications">recent publications</a> to see what we're currently up to, and feel free to get in touch! We always welcome new students, project ideas, and collaborations.
