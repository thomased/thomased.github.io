**Information** is a central currency in living systems. Our work broadly centres on understanding the ebb and flow of information in the natural world, and its profound behavioural and evolutionary consequences for organisms, including humans. Some areas of enduring interest include: 

### Communication and deception

All organisms need to gather and exchange information with the world at large, and we are broadly interested in understanding the mechanisms, causes and evolutionary consequences of this basic challenge. Current projects are focused on understanding how suites of traits coevolve to enable communication in 'noisy' natural environments, how the information encoded in diverse visual cues (colour, pattern, motion) is integrated to inform crucial decisions, and the vital role of communication in shaping local adaptation and survival amidst unpredictable environmental change. We also have longstanding interests in dis- and misinformation, how it flows through biological and social networks, and its evolutionary consequences. The [colour polymorphic lures](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&as_q=jewelled+spider) of tropical spiders have proven a rich model in predator-prey deception, while [flies](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&as_q=fly+iridescent) present a window to sexual selection and conflict, though many questions remain. We enjoy [testing and extending methods](http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/beheco/ary017) for analysing colour and vision in nature, as well as developing [software]({{ site.url }}/software) that improves the accessibility of such tools. 

### Invertebrate experience, welfare, and ethics

Do invertebrates feel pain? Do insects respond to harms reflexively, or do they showcase flexibility which might suggest a richer sensory 'experience'? What are the welfare impacts of animal production, including the rapidly expanding use of invertebrates? And what are the implications for how we treat the majority of animal life? We have a deep interest in exploring the internal and external experiences of animals. Such questions are exciting for their promise of insight into the fundamentals of perception, experience, and sentience. And for unravelling the profound practical and ethical consequences for how we responsibly interact with animals in our daily lives, especially at-scale via agriculture, recreation, and management. 

### Pollinators in natural and managed systems

How do flower-visiting insects find, select, and remember floral resources? Can pollinators weigh information across modalities to overcome noise? What is the value of lesser-studied systems, like syrphid and muscid flies, to crop pollination? We are keen to understand the role of non-traditional insects as pollinators, from both fundamental and applied perspectives. Current projects span floral foraging and sensory ecology in flies and butterflies, and how cues across modalities reinforce and/or interfere to affect decision-making.
