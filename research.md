Some areas of enduring interest include: 

### Communication

Everything needs to communicate with the world at large, and we are broadly interested in understanding the mechanisms, causes and evolutionary consequences of this basic challenge. Current projects examine how suites of traits coevolve to enable the effective exchange of information in 'noisy' natural environments, how the information encoded in diverse visual cues (colour, pattern, motion etc.) is integrated and weighed, and the role of communication in shaping local adaptation and speciation. We also enjoy [testing and extending methods](http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/beheco/ary017) for analysing colour and vision in nature, as well as developing [software]({{ site.url }}/software) that improves the accessibility of such tools. 

### Natural and sexual selection in the wild

Can we predict the trajectory of evolution? How does sexual and natural selection mediate adaptation? We are keen to understand the workings of adaptive evolution in nature. Current projects span sexual selection, dynamic signalling, and local adaptation in [iridescent flies](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&as_q=fly+iridescent), as well as the role of sensory biases in [sexual](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&as_q=structural+colour+butterfly) and [deceptive](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&as_q=jewelled+spider) signal evolution. We are also interested in using urban environments as novel testing grounds for theory, and understanding the consequences of the human modification of sensory landscapes.

### The evolution and maintenance of extreme variation

Species that exhibit conspicuous variation—such as polymorphism and sexual dimorphism—offer exciting opportunities for studying the evolutionary, ecological, and genetic basis of life's diversity. We have a long-standing interest in these extremes, such as the [colour polymorphic lures](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&as_q=jewelled+spider) of tropical spiders and the [sexually dimorphic ornaments](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&as_q=fly+iridescent) of flies, which are puzzles that we're still working to unravel.
