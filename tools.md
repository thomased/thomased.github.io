# Software

We enjoy testing and extending methods for understanding the world, and prefer such tools to be as open and accessible as possible. To that end we have developed and contributed to various pieces of software, including the below which are actively maintained.

`pavo` offers a flexible and integrated workflow for working with spectral and spatial colour data. It includes functions that take advantage of new data classes to work seamlessly from importing raw spectra and images, to publication-quality visualisations, and analyses via a suite of analytical methods and visual models.

If you **need help** with the package, take a look at the [documentation](http://pavo.colrverse.) and [extended vignettes](http://pavo.colrverse.com/articles/pavo-1-overview.html), and keep an eye on the [latest news](http://pavo.colrverse.com/news/index.html) for changes. We're always happy to receive feedback and suggestions via personal email or the mailing list: [r-pavo@googlegroups.com](mailto:r-pavo@googlegroups.com). If you have a bug to report, weâ€™d appreciate it if you could also include a reproducible example when possible.

**Current release:** 2.9.0

**Development version:** 2.10.0

**Installation:** The current release of `pavo` is available on CRAN and can be installed using ```install.packages('pavo')``` within R. The bleeding-edge version is on [github](https://github.com/rmaia/pavo), and is most easily installed with the [remotes](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) package, by running ```remotes::install_github('rmaia/pavo')```.

# Gadgets

We often build our own bits & pieces for experiments, which is made simpler with the help of 3D printing. Below are some odds & ends I've created that might be of use. For 3D printable models I've included the style (.sty) files, which are ready to be edited (if desired), 'sliced', and sent to your printer of choice. If you don't have access to a printer but feel something may be useful to you feel free to get in touch (especially students & ECRs) and I'll happily try and help as time & resources allow.

<p align="right">
<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/tools/flowers.png" title="Flowers" class="profile">  
</p>

A set of nine 'flower' discs and a base to hold them. Can be topped with coloured card for flying choice assays for various pollinators. Note the flowers have a small well in the centre, for holding liquids or materials (like cotton) to wick liquids. The flowers and base are included separately.

**[Download]({{ site.url }}/tools/flowers.zip)** (.zip file) contains:
  - flower_base.sty: the nine-hole base.
  - flower_set.sty: set of nine 'flowers', as depicted.
