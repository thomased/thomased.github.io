We often build our own bits & pieces for experiments, which is made even simpler with the help of 3D printing. Below are some things I've created that might be of use. For 3D printable models I've included the style (.sty) files, which are ready to be edited (if desired), 'sliced', and sent to your printer of choice.

## Choice arena

A small arena with slots in the walls to hold 30 mm pieces of card. Useful for walking colour/stimulus choice assays. The download includes a six-card and eight-card version.

## Artificial 'flowers' with base

</p>

A set of nine 'flower' discs and a base to hold them. Can be topped with coloured card for flying choice assays for various pollinators. Note the flowers have a small well in the centre, for holding liquids or materials (like cotton) to wick liquids. The flowers and base are included separately.
