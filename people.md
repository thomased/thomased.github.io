<p><strong>Dr. Thomas White</strong></p>
I'm an evolutionary biologist with a particular interest in behaviour, sensory ecology, and communication. I mostly work with invertebrates (particularly insects) for their tractability in addressing questions of evolution and behaviour, and for the unique opportunities for discovery offered by non-model organisms.
