Our research is motivated by a desire to understand life's diversity, and we use experimental, observational, and theoretical tools to test evolutionary theory. We tend to prefer invertebrates for their experimental tractability for questions of evolution and behaviour, though will use any system appropriate for the problem at hand. Some areas of particular interest include:

I'm an evolutionary biologist with a particular interest in behaviour, sensory ecology, and communication. I mostly work with invertebrates (particularly insects) for their tractability in addressing questions of evolution and behaviour, and for the unique opportunities for discovery offered by non-model organisms.
