### Entomology (BIOL2033)

_Insects are the most abundant and diverse group of animals on earth; beetles alone account for 25% of animal life. Insects impact almost every facet of the ecosystem and our lives. Many insects play valuable and essential roles in pollinating different plant species, in predating and controlling insect pests and in recycling nutrients. Other insects are harmful and are the vectors for major diseases such as plague, malaria and recently emerged viral disease Zika. This unit provides students with a broad introduction to entomology including insect evolution, ecology, anatomy and physiology._

### Integrated Pest Management (ENTO4003)

_The focus of this unit is the development and adoption of sustainable integrated pest management (IPM) within Australian (and global) agriculture. It builds on the knowledge gained in second year entomology and is a core unit for the entomology specialisation. Applied entomology deals with the sustainable control of insect pests using a variety of techniques such as biological control and habitat manipulation._
