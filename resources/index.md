# Resources

If you're interested in sensory ecology and the study of colour, there is a [directory](http://colsci.weebly.com/contact.html) of labs and people that work in the field, along with a [slack](https://slack.com/downloads) channel for chatting about papers, gear, and coordinating a journal club. All are welcome, just ask for an invite. There's also a very active community on twitter, including a [bot](https://twitter.com/colsci_papers) for the latest papers, and a [hashtag](https://twitter.com/#colsci).
