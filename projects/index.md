# Colour polymorphism

The maintenance of adaptive variation is a classic problem in evolutionary biology. Colour polymorphisms&mdash;discrete coloured forms within a species&mdash;offer a simple visual tool with which to explore the evolutionary processes that maintain variation. My PhD research is focused on the potential for ‘sensory drive’ to generate and maintain polymorphism in a poorly understood class of deceptive visual signal: prey lures. Drawing on spiders that use conspicuous colours to attract prey, such as the magnificent [_Gasteracantha_](http://www.google.com/images?q=gasteracantha) spp., I'm working to better understand the evolution of this striking feature of the natural world.

# Iridescence

Iridescent structural colours are the most dazzling and diverse visual displays found in nature. The stunning colour patterns showcased by butterflies, for one, are a product of the mixing of thousands of individually coloured scales that cover the wing. Selection in this group has generated both complex structures&mdash;such as multilayer reflectors, diffraction gratings, and 3-D gyroid crystals&mdash;and intricate display behaviours. This makes butterflies a great system for exploring the evolution of iridescent signalling systems, and my research is focused on both proximate and ultimate questions.

# Measuring colour

To understand the evolution of colour pattern diversity we need to 'see' the world as non-human animals do. I'm interested in testing and developing methods for analysing colour traits and their visual perception, which is an exciting and [rapidly growing](https://github.com/thomased/colour_methods_papers) area of research.
