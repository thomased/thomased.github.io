# pavo  

**An R package for the organization, visualisation, and perceptual analysis of spectral colour data in R**

We are excited to announce the stable release of **version 1.0** of pavo; the comprehensive R package for handling and analysing colour data. This release includes a suite of new modelling and visualisation tools in a more flexible framework, along with a number of minor improvements.

If you **need help** with the package, take a look at the [documentation](http://rafaelmaia.net/pavo/reference/index.html) and [extended vignette](http://rafaelmaia.net/pavo/articles/pavo.html), and keep an eye on the [latest news](http://rafaelmaia.net/pavo/news/index.html) for changes. We're always happy to receive feedback and suggestions, so feel free to join pavo's [gitter page](https://gitter.im/r-pavo/help) (public chat room) if you need further assistance. If you have a bug to report, weâ€™d appreciate it if you could also include a reproducible example when possible.

**Stable release:** 1.1.0 (06/05/2017)

**Installation:** The current stable version of pavo is available on CRAN, and can simply be installed using ```install.packages('pavo')``` within R. The bleeding-edge version is on [github](https://github.com/rmaia/pavo), and is most easily installed with Hadley Wickham's [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) package, by running ```devtools::install_github('rmaia/pavo')```.
