- [**How animals follow the stars**](http://dx.doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2017.2322) ([pdf](http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royprsb/285/1871/20172322.full.pdf)). A compelling review of the information in the stars, and the animals that use it. 

- [**A bony-crested Jurassic dinosaur with evidence of iridescent plumage highlights complexity in early paravian evolution**](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-017-02515-y) ([pdf](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02515-y.pdf)). Further fleshing out the story of iridescent [feathered dinosaurs](https://xkcd.com/1104/).

- [**Using Human Vision to Detect Variation in Avian Coloration: How Bad Is It?**](https://doi.org/10.1086/695282) ([pdf](http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/pdfplus/10.1086/695282)). I'm still sceptical, and think we can/should do better as a rule, but its nice to know it may not as bad as all that if we have to rely on human judgement to assess colour variation.

- [**Social transmission of avoidance among predators facilitates the spread of novel prey**](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41559-017-0418-x) ([pdf](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41559-017-0418-x.pdf)). A wonderful demonstration of how social learning can amplify the the efficacy and spread of aposematism. 

- And the [super blue blood moon](http://www.abc.net.au/news/science/2018-01-24/beginners-guide-to-the-moon/9320770) is due Jan 31, around 11:30 pm (AEDT) for the best view.
