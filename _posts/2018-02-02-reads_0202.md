Photoreceptors everywhere! Except at the seemingly obvious focal points of the 'microlenses' that adorn the stars' dorsum.   

- [**Artificial chameleon skin that controls spectral radiation: Development of Chameleon Cool Coating**](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-19498-5) ([pdf](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-19498-5.pdf)).

- [**Conserving honey bees does not help wildlife**](http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.aar2269) ([pdf](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/359/6374/392.full.pdf)). Honey bees aren't the only, or even majority, pollinators.
