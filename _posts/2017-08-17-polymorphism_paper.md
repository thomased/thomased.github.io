Our latest paper---and the last from my PhD (phew)--- on [deceptive colour polymorphism](https://www.google.com/search?tbm=isch&as_q=jewelled+spider) is out in [BMC Evolutionary Biology](http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12862-017-1043-7). It's an experimental test of the idea, fleshed out [in an earlier paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/evo.12948), that the 'white' and 'yellow' morphs of the spiny spider _G. fornicata_ may essentially represent alternate strategies for standing out amidst the visual noise of their forest habitats. We find partial support across a handful of experiments, with prey learning (I used only colour-naive flies) being an obvious axis of variation that remains to be explored.
