- [**Auditory opportunity and visual constraint enabled the evolution of echolocation in bats**](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-017-02532-x) ([pdf](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02532-x.pdf))

- [**Large-scale transcriptome changes in the process of long-term visual memory formation in the bumblebee, _Bombus terrestris_**](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-017-18836-3) ([pdf](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-18836-3.pdf))

- The entire December issue of Vision Science focused on [**Individual differences as a window into the structure and function of the visual system**](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/00426989/141/supp/C). The _human_ visual system anyway, but showcases some interesting work.

- Darwin (the city) has been enjoying some [optical delights in the wet season](http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-01-15/science-behind-sunsets-darwin-wet-season/9329202)

- [**To Save Drowning People, Ask Yourself “What Would Light Do?”**](http://nautil.us/blog/-to-save-drowning-people-ask-yourself-what-would-light-do). A nice discussion of Fermat's theorem. See Feynman's wonderful [QED](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QED:_The_Strange_Theory_of_Light_and_Matter) for a much-extended but accessible take.
