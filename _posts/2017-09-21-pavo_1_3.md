Version 1.3 of [pavo](http://rafaelmaia.net/pavo/) is on its way through CRAN, so be sure to update in the next day or two. It's a serious update! So serious that we rolled through two increments before we actually got it out. 

Big changes include a handful of new functions to make life easier, like `sensdata()` for easily retrieving `pavo's` internal data, and the addition of the CIELCh model (the cylindrical transformation of CIELab), accessible via `colspace()`. Rafael has done some amazing work by adding in noise-corrected colorspaces, as well totally rewriting the 3d plots (tetrachromatic and CIELab) for far better control and aesthetics. 

_NEW FUNCTIONS_
* `jnd2xyz()` converts distances (in JND, resulting from a `coldist()` call) into cartesian coordinates
* `plot()` methods for objects resulting from `jnd2xyz()`
* `jndrot()` produces rotations of Cartesian coordinates resulting from `jnd2xyz()`
* `coldist2mat()` converts `coldist()` result from a pairwise data.frame to a distance matrix
* `sensdata()` function for retrieving and/or visualising pavo's in-build spectral data 

_MAJOR CHANGES_
* `tetraplot()` and `cieplot()` have been completely rewritten to allow finer viewing control
* `tetraplot()` allows forced perspective using size to denote distance
* `voloverlap()` and `vol()` have also been changed to work with the new `tetraplot()` options
* `getspec()` has been rewritten to be faster, more general, and allow parallel processing
* subset functions now allow more than one argument to be used, and allow further attributes to be passed onto grep (e.g. invert = TRUE)

_MINOR FEATURES AND BUG FIXES_
* fixed bug in `coldist()` on log-transformation when object was neither of class vismodel nor colspace
* fixed bug in dL calculation when input is a colspace object
* fixed bug in `vismodel()` when a data frame, matrix or rspec object was passed as the background
* fixed bug in `colspace()` models when using non-standard receptor names or ordering
* fixed bug in `hexagon()` model when calculating location & metrics for achromatic stimuli
* fixed location of red vertex in `tetraplot()`
* fixed bug in the argument names for expanding text labels in colspace plots
* removed na.rm argument from `aggspec()` that was causing a bug when the error function did not have that argument. User should pass it as an argument to the function if necessary.
* changed default to `achro=FALSE` in `coldist()` 
* replaced the modelled receptor sensitivities of the honeybee _Apis melifera_ with the empirical sensitivities from Peitsch et al (1992)
* the built-in 'green' background spectrum is no longer normalized
* removed wavelength limitations in the calculation of H3 from summary.rspec
* all visual systems (except CIE) have been normalized to have an integral of 1
