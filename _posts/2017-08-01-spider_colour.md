I recently had the opportunity to provide comment on [a neat paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.anbehav.2017.06.016) on deceptive spider colouration for The New Scientist â€” the resulting write-up can be found [in their news section](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2141493-spiders-web-uses-optical-illusion-to-lure-nocturnal-moths/).
