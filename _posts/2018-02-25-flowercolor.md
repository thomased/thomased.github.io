I was fortunate to be involved with a project on elevational gradients in floral colouration in the Rockies, and the unedited version is [now online at The Journal of Ecology.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1365-2745.12948)

1. Floral colour is a fundamental signal that shapes plant-pollinator interactions. Despite theoretical reasons why floral colours might shift in representation along biotic and abiotic gradients, few studies have examined community-level shifts in colour, and even fewer significant patterns have been detected.

4. Synthesis: Hue patterns are consistent with the hypothesis that bee pollinators have shaped the geography of floral color. The roles of fly pollinators and of abiotic drivers are more difficult to infer, although the drop in floral brightness at high elevations is consistent with predictions that low temperatures and more intense UV radiation should favour increased pigment concentrations there. Our results indicate that floral colour can be dynamic yet predictable across the landscape, a pattern that provides opportunities to tease apart the ecological and evolutionary drivers of this important plant trait.
