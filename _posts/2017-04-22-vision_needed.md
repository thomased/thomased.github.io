# Your vision needed
*2017-04-22*

We're running some experiments to understand human visual perception in noisy, real-world settings, and if you happen to be reside around [Macquarie University](ww.mq.edu.au) we'd appreciate your help.

**What you’d do:** stroll along a 100-m forest track and tell us which coloured model objects you spy. Ideally once on a sunny and once on a cloudy day. All involvement is completely anonymous.

**Where:** Macquarie University campus near the fauna park (between E8A and W19)

**When:** Between 11am and 2pm on 1 – 2 weekdays in the first half of May, with flexibility as to your regular daily schedule.

**Your reward:** Some lunchtime exercise, a warm-fuzzy feeling from helping push back the bounds of science, and probably chocolate. Once you’ve finished strolling, we’d love to share all details of the experiment, what the science predicted and why, etc. You can choose to receive any ultimate study outcomes (reports/papers).

This is a collaborative venture lead by [Bibiana Rojas](https://bibianarojas.co), along with [Darrell Kemp](www.evolutionaryecologymq.com).

Please email [DK](mailto:darrell.kemp@mq.edu.au) if you’re able to help.
