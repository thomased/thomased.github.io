[Structural Absorption by Barbule Microstructures of Super Black Bird of Paradise Feathers](http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41467-017-02088-w) ([pdf](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-02088-w.pdf)). Spectacular birds of paradise use 'structural absorption' to create nature's blackest blacks. With a nice write up in [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2018/01/super-black-is-the-new-black/549869/?single_page=true).

[Hybrid Speciation Leads to Novel Male Secondary Sexual Ornamentation of an Amazonian Bird](www.pnas.org/cgi/doi/10.1073/pnas.1717319115) ([pdf](http://sci-hub.la/10.1073/pnas.1717319115)).

[A Triassic-Jurassic Window into the Evolution of Lepidoptera](http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/sciadv.1701568) ([pdf](http://advances.sciencemag.org/content/advances/4/1/e1701568.full.pdf)). Pushes back the radiation of moths and butterflies ca. 70 mya to the late Jurassic, thus well and truly pre-dating flowering plants.

[Color Processing in the Early Visual System of Drosophila](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2017.12.018) ([pdf](http://dx.doi.org.sci-hub.hk/10.1016/j.cell.2017.12.018)). Further untangles the circuitry of colour-opponency in Dros, and reveals some very early-stage processing.
