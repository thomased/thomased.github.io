Our paper 'Comparing colours using visual models' was recently accepted following some helpful comments, and the [final updated preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/01/08/175992) is now up. [Rafael](http://rafaelmaia.net) also crafted a wonderful [new supplement](https://github.com/rmaia/msdichromatism/blob/master/Rmd/ESM.md) that walks through various example analyses. The shiny formatted version should be up at _Behavioural Ecology_ before long â€” take a look and let us know what you think!
