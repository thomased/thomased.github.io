I am always happy to hear from motivated students at all levels; from potential PhD's to undergraduate students looking for hands-on experience. I have a number of projects available, or am open to any ideas that broadly align with my [research interests]({{ site.url }}/research). Take a look at some [publications]({{ site.url }}/publications), and send me an email!

Aside from the very occasional funded position, there are numerous routes to securing funding for honours, PhD's, and postdocs. A few are listed below, and I will gladly do all I can to help qualified applicants secure support.

### Postgraduates

**PhD and Masters**  
The University of Sydney is a world-class research institution, and offers a vibrant environment within which to pursue postgraduate studies. Students will need to secure a scholarship such as an Australian Postgraduate Award or the University's equivalent (which share an application), and applications are typically due in ***October***.

**Honours**  
Honours is an extra year of study following an undergraduate degree, and involves a substantial independent research component. It's an excellent opportunity to gain significant research and project management experience, and is also a common pathway to higher-degree research.

### Postdocs

**USyd Fellowships**  
The University of Sydney offers its flagship Postdoctoral Fellowships on a yearly basis, with applications due in ***September***.

**Endeavour Awards**  
Endeavour awards are short-term scholarships offered by the Australian government that allow researchers from almost anywhere to visit an Australian university for 4-6 months. Applications close in ***April*** each year (for funding the following year).

**Branco Weiss Fellowships**  
This research fellowship is designed to support postdoctoral researchers after their PhD and before their first faculty appointment. Those in current postdoctoral positions are also eligible. Ideally, fellows pursue unconventional projects in new areas of science, engineering and social sciences.

**Marie Marie Sklodowska-Curie Global Fellowships**  
These generous fellowships support secondments outside Europe for researchers based in the EU or associated countries.

There is also [a curated list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1J2M_tQgoqV4ivpfEClh9qs9f2KQN2O1G3Jpda2aoHfQ/htmlview) of fellowships from around the world that's well worth taking a look at.
