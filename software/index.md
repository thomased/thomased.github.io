# pavo  

**An R package for the organization, visualisation, and perceptual analysis of spectral colour data in R**

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rmaia/pavo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rmaia/pavo/branches)

We are excited to announce the stable release of **version 1.0** of pavo; the comprehensive R package for handling and analysing colour data. This release includes a suite of new modelling and visualisation tools in a more flexible framework, along with a number of minor improvements. Take a look at the [introductory vignette](http://tomwhite.io/pavo-1_0.html) for an outline of the changes, which is also accessible within R through a call to ```browseVignettes('pavo')```.

We're always happy to receive feedback and suggestions, so feel free to join pavo's [gitter page](https://gitter.im/r-pavo/help) (public chat room) if you need help or if you'd like to keep an eye on announcements. If you have a bug to report, weâ€™d appreciate it if you could also include a reproducible example when possible.

**Stable release:** 1.0! (05/12/2016)

**Installation:** The current stable version of pavo is available on CRAN, and can simply be installed using ```install.packages('pavo')``` within R. The bleeding-edge version is on [github](https://github.com/rmaia/pavo), and is most easily installed with Hadley Wickham's [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) package, by running ```devtools::install_github('rmaia/pavo')```.

# pattern

**An R package for the analysis of colour pattern geometry**

[![cran version](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/pattern)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=pattern/) [![Project Status: Wip - Initial development is in progress, but there has not yet been a stable, usable release suitable for the public.](http://www.repostatus.org/badges/0.1.0/wip.svg)](http://www.repostatus.org/#wip) [![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thomased/pattern.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/thomased/pattern)

A toolbox for the analysis of colour pattern geometry in R. Currently very much under-construction, but will eventually implement various methods from the literature in a manner complementary to [pavo](https://github.com/rmaia/pavo) (which handles the spectral data analysis and visual modelling work). A stable release should be available later this year.

**Installation:** The development version is available via devtools ```devtools::install_github('thomased/pattern')```

# Nature's palette

**All-natural colour palettes for R**

[![cran version](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/pattern)](https://cran.r-project.org/package=natpalette/) [![Travis-CI Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/thomased/pattern.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/thomased/natpalette)

A selection of questionably useful palettes drawn from by the world in colour. See the [github page](https://github.com/thomased/natpalette) for examples, and feel free to send along an image of your study organism for inclusion. Inspired by the excellent [wesanderson](https://github.com/karthik/wesanderson) package from [Karthik Ram](http://inundata.org).

**Installation:** via devtools ```devtools::install_github('thomased/natpalette')```
