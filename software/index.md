[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/rmaia/pavo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/rmaia/pavo/branches)

We are excited to announce the stable release of **version 1.0** of pavo; the comprehensive R package for handling and analysing colour data. This release includes a suite of new modelling and visualisation tools in a more flexible framework, along with a number of minor improvements. Take a look at the [introductory vignette](http://tomwhite.io/pavo-1_0.html) for an outline of the changes, which is also accessible within R through a call to ```browseVignettes('pavo')```.

We're always happy to receive feedback and suggestions, so feel free to join pavo's [gitter page](https://gitter.im/r-pavo/help) (public chat room) if you need help or if you'd like to keep an eye on announcements. If you have a bug to report, weâ€™d appreciate it if you could also include a reproducible example when possible.

**Stable release:** 1.1 (06/05/2017)

**Installation:** The current stable version of pavo is available on CRAN, and can simply be installed using ```install.packages('pavo')``` within R. The bleeding-edge version is on [github](https://github.com/rmaia/pavo), and is most easily installed with Hadley Wickham's [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) package, by running ```devtools::install_github('rmaia/pavo')```.
