# pavo

**An R package for the organization, visualisation, and perceptual analysis of spectral colour data in R**

**Stable release:** 0.5-6 (20/10/2016)

I've recently had the pleasure of joining the [development team](http://rafaelmaia.net/pavo/) for [pavo](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.12069), a comprehensive R package for handling and analysing colour data. We're currently working on a suite of new tools and models for the upcoming major release. Join pavo's [gitter page](https://gitter.im/r-pavo/help) (public chat room) if you need help or if you'd like to keep an eye on announcements.
