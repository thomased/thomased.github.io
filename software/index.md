# pavo

**An R package for the organization, visualisation, and perceptual analysis of spectral colour data in R**

I've had the pleasure of joining the [development team](http://rafaelmaia.net/pavo/) for [pavo](https://github.com/rmaia/pavo); a comprehensive R package for handling and analysing colour data. We're currently working on a suite of new tools and models for the upcoming major release. Feel free to join pavo's [gitter page](https://gitter.im/r-pavo/help) (public chat room) if you need help or if you'd like to keep an eye on announcements.

**Stable release:** 0.5-6 (20/10/2016)

**Installation:** The current stable version of pavo is available on CRAN, and can simply be installed using ```install.packages('pavo')``` within R. The bleeding-edge version is most easily accessed via Hadley Wickham's [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) package, by running ```devtools::install_github('rmaia/pavo')```.
